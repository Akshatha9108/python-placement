Constant time complexity: o(1)=excellent/Best
-
- When I/P not depend on input size

Logarthmic time complexity: o(log n)=good
-
- Input reduce by half ,may be in iterating,handling recurrsion

Linear time complexity:o(n)=fair
-
- when you have single loop within ur algo

Logarthmic time complexity: o(nlogn)=Bad
-
o(n^2),o(2^n),o(n!)=horrible/Worst,
- 
- Nested loop within ur algo ,means loop in loop -->O(n^2)
- growth rate double with each addition to input -->O(2^n)
